# DataFrame Reshaping Script
This script demonstrates how to reshape a DataFrame in Python using pandas. 

**Functionality:**
1. Reads CSV data:** Loads data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Cleans column names:** Removes text within square brackets from column names.
3. Converts columns to numeric:** Converts specified columns to numeric data types, handling potential errors.
4. Reshapes data:** Uses `melt()` to reshape the DataFrame, preparing it for pivoting.
5. Creates pivot table:** Creates a pivot table to summarize the data by Year and Series Name.
6. Displays output:** Displays the first few rows of the pivoted DataFrame.

**Usage:
1. **Place the CSV file:** Ensure the CSV file (`SSA_Data.csv`) is located in the same directory as the script.
2. **Run the script:** Execute the Python script using `python your_script_name.py`.

Dependencies:
- pandas

**Note:**
- This is a basic example. You may need to adjust the code based on your specific data and requirements.
- The script assumes that the first column in the DataFrame does not need to be converted to numeric.
- The `errors='coerce'` argument in `pd.to_numeric()` handles invalid values by replacing them with NaN. You may need to adjust this based on your data handling requirements.
